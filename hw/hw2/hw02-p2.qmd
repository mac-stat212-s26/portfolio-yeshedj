## Instructions

**Task:** Open up the New York Times article [A Summer of Strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business/economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html), and scroll down to the plot titled "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades (Share of the work force in a union, by industry)".

![](https://hash-mac.github.io/stat212site-sp26/images/challenge-2-goal.png)

Using `ggplot2` and other tools in R, recreate this plot. Note that you will need to create the data underlying the plot yourself. You can create this data in R with `tibble()`. You can also write the data in Excel or Google Sheets and export it as a CSV file.

**Requirements:**

- Overall
  - Panels for "All workers", "By Sector", and "By Industry" are shown.
  - Arrows showing the change from 1983 to 2022 are shown.
    - Note: be sure that the arrows all point in the correct direction!
  - The actual percentages in 1983 and 2022 are shown as text.
  - X-axis tick marks are at 0, 25, and 50.
  - Plot title says "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades".
  - Plot subtitle says "Share of the work force in a union, by industry".
- Resource reflection
    - At least 1 resource is listed
    - At least 3 sentences about resources and their helpfulness in the task

**Bonus**: Additional possibilities to enhance your visualization include adjusting the default aesthetics of the arrows, aligning your plots neatly, and adding margins in order to left-align the y-axis text.

Within each of the legal natures, we see distinct differences between the size categories, with larger enterprises generally holding more capital than micro or smaller enterprises. We also see that certain legal structures are more common for specific sized categories, and that the relationship between size and capital differs a bit by its legal structure.",

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis reveals that both the legal nature and the company size are associated with different capital levels among Brazilian companies. Based on the way these two factors interacted, we can understand that business capital in Brazil has to consider multiple different factors of how the companies are organized and classified. These patterns can help policymakers and investors better interpret business classifications and make more informed decisions.",
